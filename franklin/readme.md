ROMs for the Franklin Ace Display Card (80 col) -- similar to the Videx Videoterm but with intergrated soft switch and other improvements.

Use the FIXED ROM on your card if you want the video output to look similar to the stock Apple II video output. (In size and position.)

When using the ROM, the descenders will be chopped off, so you will need to use the 9x7 font ROM here to fix that problem. PHAT font is a C64-like double pixel font and the regular 9x7 is just the stock font modified to not be cut off.
